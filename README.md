 ## Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub! <3 

My name is Olivia and I'm a 4th-year Biochemistry student with a newfound passion for **Bioinformatics**. As someone still exploring the exciting world of computational research, I'm eager to dive into new projects, learn, and grow along the way. I'll be focusing on bacterial organisms for my work, as their smaller genome size is more manageable.

This GitHub will be my space to share my work, progress, and discoveries as I embark on this in silico learning journey.

Thanks for stopping by â€” I'm excited to have you join me! ðŸš€
